# JohnsAdventure
Hi and welcome to the Open Source of John's Adventure! ⚔🛡🏹

Our goal is to remake the existing https://gamejolt.com/games/johns_adventure/556539 and give a new experience to our players! Including more fighting! more gameplay! more story! and many more 👀

If you are a beta tester, welcome! ✌️

The one and only rule I demand for Developers:
Follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid)
