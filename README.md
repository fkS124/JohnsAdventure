Hi and welcome to the Open Source of John's Adventure! ⚔🛡🏹

|LGTMGradePython| https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Code%20quality-Green

My goal is to remake the existing https://gamejolt.com/games/johns_adventure/556539 and give a new experience to our players!
Including more fighting! more gameplay! more story! and many more 👀


If you are a beta tester, welcome! ✌️
Please use this source to access deep secrets of john's adventure (please don't spoil anyone) ⚔️ 

Reminder ❗❗❗❗
Do not specifically demand your name in the official game's credits, everyone who helped on bug fixing is going to get a equal message! 
No selfishness in this project!☝️


If you are waiting for the final version, im very sorry but it will take lot's of time since im the only one who does the coding! Please be patient 🙏
