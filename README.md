# John's Adventures : Chapter 1

Welcome to John's adventures chapter 1. Here is the source code of a game project, started *seriously* at early August 2021 and 
ended in March 2022. This game was an original idea of Marios Papazogloy, who was the main programmer, until Theophile Aumont
joined the project.
This game is entirely made with python and pygame. (See [requirements](./requirements.txt) for the package versions.)


## Usage
To run the game, first install all the required packages using :
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or eventually :
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the game using :
```shell
python main.py
# or eventually on linux
python3 main.py
```
And if you want to get directly the executable files check the [itch page]("https://ibox-studios.itch.io/johns-adventure-chapter-1").
